# Marvin Mood Fortune

A tiny terminal toy that prints a "Marvin-style" mood line and a micro‑fortune.

## Run

```bash
python3 marvin_mood.py
```

## Fun bits / Easter eggs

- 12% chance to print a hidden Marvin one‑liner.
- If run at **00:42**, it prints a special line.
- Set `MARVIN_VERBOSE=1` for an extra status line.

## Example

```
      .----.
     / .--. \
    | |    | |
    | |    | |
    | |    | |
    | '----' |
     \______/

Mood: A little dramatic, still functional.
Fortune: Your next small decision will quietly save an hour later.
Easter egg: 42 is still the answer. The question is still missing.
```
